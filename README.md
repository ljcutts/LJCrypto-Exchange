# LJCrypto-Exchange

This is an exchange built by me where you can buy, sell, stake tokens and nfts. There is a page where you can interact with a guessing and lottery game. Not to mention you can use your tokens and nfts to create, vote, and execute proposals for governance. Then there is using the tokens to add to liquidity pools and enable decentralized swaps.
